# ts2cpp

## Overview
This project is based off of [ts2c], transpiling TS/JS to C++. Because I wanted the transpiled code to be as readable as possible, the first step in this project is to manually transpile all of the Javascript global objects ([MDN][MDN-Globals]).

## Reasoning

## JS in C++
The header and source files for the C++ implementation of JS Global Objects can be found at [/include/js](/include/js).
